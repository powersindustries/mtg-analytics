## Cheapest Way to Play Magic the Gathering
This project (mtg_pricing directory) contains average calculations for the pricing of all cards in Magic the Gathering. In these scripts, we calulate the average cost by color for all cards along with the averages broken down by game mode (Standard, Modern, Legacy, and Commander).
